Digital Art AI agents and ML training experiments

Summary repo of the project for the usage of AI Agents and ML models for digital art.
All 3 projects are in development and receive frequent updates.

This project has links to 3 separate directories and a brief description:
Backend and frontend projects require Docker for setup.
Jupyter notebooks were tested in the Google Colab environment.

1.) Backend:
https://github.com/leropo00/backend_digital_art


Implemented in Python and FastAPI, this application provides CRUD functionalities for managing art ideas and reference materials, along with AI agent features.


2.) Frontend:
https://github.com/leropo00/frontend_digital_art

Frontend used to test the functionalities that the backend provides.


3.) Jupyter Notebooks and Models Training:
https://github.com/leropo00/ml_digital_art


Jupyter Notebook for training the models in the domain.
Also includes notebooks on tutorials on how to use certain libraries,
as well as study notebooks on certain Machine Learning principles.

It is also possible that notebooks of some other challenges outside of the domain, like Kaggle competitions, will be added here.
